# Piscine 42 - July 2019

Copy/Pasting exercices without understanding is bad, for you and for the wellness of the piscine. This repo is only here to help you **UNDERSTAND** exercices.

Every exercices is correct and has been approved by the Moulinette. However, keep in mind that Moulinette might be often updated.

There are also slight changes in BSQ subject each year, and check it in multiple languages to be sure.
BSQ in this repo passed the functionnal test, but is not fully optimized. Credits to Violetta Goldman for this one.
